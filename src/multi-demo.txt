''' Multidrone demonstration Overview:
Backgrounds:
	John
	Omar
	Eric
		- Background / from
		- Inspiration + Restrictions
		- Breakthrough
		- HS robotics
		- Path to College -> Founder of robotics clubs
		- Currently 3 projects, 1 competition, $X in funding (so we're happy to be here)

Everyone else is working with one drone:
 - first drone rises
But the real power of autonomy comes when the mases combine:
 - second drone rises
We've written a set of scripts and modified the nodeJS drone library
to enable virtually limitless simultaneous control of multiple drones
 - third drone rises

What we've written makes it easier for *everyone* in here to organize
a drone swarm.  Now your drones can behave independently
 - first goes to left
 - second goes forward
 - third goes right
 - (stop after 3/4 sec)
They can react and respond to each other
 - one rotates cw
 	- .5 sec later two rotates cw
 		- .5 sec later three rotates cw
 - 1 sec later all stop
And they can act as one unit
 - all three move forward
-(all land)
-This is only the beginning. These robots can move on to localize themselves AND each other in space
and then ineract and maneuver around each other efficiently and collision free.
  - We wish we could be showing you this today.  When this event was converted from a Hack-a-thon to a
  pre-prepared routine and presentation, us lowly freshman were pitted against our final papers and 
  exams this week, and had to leave our work to yesterday night into this morning
  - Missing a full 8 hours of sleep each, the three of us were able to make today, but sadly our localization
  and mapping algorithms were a few hours short of a demo
-Regardless, our Multidrone communication rewrite will be pushed soon and everyone here will be able to
their lonely drones the robot party they deserve
  - In fact, DroneGames and NodeCopter inspired and motivated us to add an entirely new branch to the 
  Stanford robotics clubs dedicated to drones: focused both on programming and improving the node-ar-drone
  bindings, and mechanically optimizing the commerically available product for otherwise impossible feats.
Thanks everyone!'''
